## Classification and Detection with CNN
Firstly showed how three datasets, namely training dataset, validation dataset and testing dataset, are prepared for CNN training and inference. Methodology including CNN models, model selection and preprocessing for the data is described. I then show accuracies for three models and then pick one with the highest validation accuracy and I show the detection results for 5 real-world images and a real-world video.
